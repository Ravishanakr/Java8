1.Stream: Stream is an interface introduced in Java8 
under package called java.util package.
 
2.Using streams we can perform operations on Collection Object.
3.Streams work perfectly with lambdas.
4.Streams don't store their elements.
5.Streams are immutable.


Intermediate Operations
========================
1)Intermediate operations in Java Streams return another Stream.

2)They are used to transform or filter the elements of the 
original Stream.

3)Since they are lazy, meaning they do not perform any 
processing until a terminal operation is called

4)multiple intermediate operations can be chained together.


Common Intermediate Operations:

1)map(Function<T, R>):--it will take Function

2)filter(Predicate<T>):--it will take predicate

3)distinct():-->you should override equals and hash code method

4)sorted():-->

5)limit(long n):

6)skip(long n):

7)peek(Consumer<T>):

8)flatMap(Function<T, Stream<R>>):
